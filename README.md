# AppConfig

AppConfig is a library to manage your (web) application dynamic settings with flexible access and configuration strategy.

Primary datasource for AppConfig is an ActiveRecord model.

## Installation

via rubygems:

    gem install app-config -s https://github.com/reivaxm/app-config.git
  
via github:

    git clone git://github.com/reivaxm/app-config.git
    cd app-config
    gem build
    gem install app-config-x.y.z.gem
  
## Supported platforms

- Ruby 1.8.7
- Ruby EE 1.8.7
- Ruby 1.9.2
  
## Data Formats

You can use following formats:
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- Hash

String format is a default format. Everything is a string by default.

Boolean format is just a flag, values 'true', 'on', 'yes', 'y', '1' are equal to True. Everything else is False.

Array format is a multiline text which is transformed into array. Each evelemnt will be trimmed. Empty strings are ignored.

Hash format is special key-value string, "foo: bar, user: username", which is transformed into Hash instance.
Only format "keyname: value, keyname2: value2" is supported. No nested hashes allowed.

## Usage

AppConfig is designed to work with ActiveRecord model. Only ActiveRecord >= 3.0.0 is supported.

By default model "Setting" will be used as a data source.

### Setup

In order to use AppConfig you should have a source table, similar to this:

```ruby
class CreateSettings < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :settings do |t|
      t.string   :keyname,       :null => false, :limit => 64
      t.text     :value,         :null => false
      t.string   :value_format,  :limit => 64,   :default => "string"
      t.string   :name,          :limit => 64
      t.string   :description,   :limit => 512
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :settings
  end
end
```

Required columns are:

- keyname
- value
- value_format

Columns **:name** and **:description** are optional and used only for informative purpose (ex: show name and description in admin panel).

There is no need in indexes since the data is being loaded only once on application start.

Simple model with validations should look like this:

```ruby
class Setting < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of   :keyname, :value
  validates_uniqueness_of :keyname
end
```

### Configuration

Default configuration method is:

```ruby
AppConfig.configure
```
  
If your settings model has a different schema, you can redefine columns:

```ruby
AppConfig.configure(
  :model  => Setting,           # model class name as source
  :key    => 'KEYNAME_FIELD',   # field that contains name
  :format => 'FORMAT_FIELD',    # field that contains key format
  :value  => 'VALUE_FIELD',     # field that contains value data
)
```
  
Load all settings somewhere in your application. In Rails it should be initializer file.

```ruby
AppConfig.load
```
  
Configuration in Rails 3: (you can put this into environment/ENV or application.rb)
Make sure your application does not have any critical parts depending on AppConfig at startup.

```ruby
config.after_initialize do
  AppConfig.configure(:model => Setting)
  AppConfig.load if Setting.table_exists?
end
```

AppConfig gives you 3 ways to access variables:

```ruby
AppConfig.my_setting      # method-like
AppConfig[:my_setting]    # hash-like by symbol key
AppConfig['my_setting']   # hash-like by string key
```
  
You can define settings items manually.
**NOTE:** *THESE KEYS WILL BE REMOVED ON RELOAD/LOAD.*

```ruby
AppConfig.set_key('KEYNAME', 'VALUE', 'FORMAT')
```
 
For update use 
```AppConfig.save
```
Everytime you change your settings on the fly, use reload:

```ruby
AppConfig.reload
```
  
Cleanup everything:

```ruby
AppConfig.flush
```
